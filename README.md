---

## 🧠 How It Works

### Recommendation Algorithm

1. **Data Loading**: The system loads product data from the CSV file
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Product names and brands are cleaned and normalized
3. **Vectorization**:
   - **GenAI Mode**: Products are converted to semantic embeddings using Sentence Transformers
   - **TF-IDF Mode**: Products are converted to TF-IDF vectors (fallback)
4. **Query Processing**: User input is transformed into a query vector/embedding
5. **Similarity Computation**: Cosine similarity is calculated between query and all products
6. **Filtering & Sorting**: Results are filtered by brand/budget and sorted according to user preference
7. **Ranking**: Top K most similar products are returned as recommendations

### Chatbot System

1. **Knowledge Base Generation**: Product information is extracted from CSV and organized
2. **Training Data Creation**: Training prompts are generated automatically
3. **Query Understanding**: User messages are analyzed for product queries, brands, and budgets
4. **Out-of-Scope Detection**: Detects queries about non-appliance products (phones, laptops, TVs, etc.) and provides helpful guidance
5. **Response Generation**:
   - **LLM Mode**: GPT-2 generates natural, conversational responses with optimized temperature and sampling
   - **Rule-Based Mode**: Friendly fallback responses for common patterns
   - **Natural Language**: Casual, friendly tone that feels like talking to a friend
6. **Product Integration**: Chatbot can call recommendation engine to provide product suggestions
