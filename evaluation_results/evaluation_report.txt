NOTES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RMSE and MAE: These metrics are for rating prediction tasks.
              Content-based filtering uses similarity scores, not ratings.
              These metrics are more relevant for collaborative filtering.

User-Item Interaction Matrix: Not applicable for content-based filtering.
                                Content-based systems use item features, not user interactions.
                                This matrix is required for collaborative filtering approaches.
